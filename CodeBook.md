## Project Description
__From the source:__

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain..

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

#Processing

##The Data Sets
run_analysis.R imports the train data from '/train/X_train.txt', '/train/y_train.txt', and '/train/subject_train.txt' into trainsetX, trainsetY, and SubTrain, and imports the test data from '/test/X_test.txt', '/test/y_test.txt', and '/test/subject_test.txt' into testsetX, testsetY, and SubTest. The activity labels are imported from '/activity_labels.txt' into ActivityLabel, and the names of the measurements are imported from '/features.txt' into features.

##The Transformations
run_analysis.R does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Exports the new data set to a text file

1. Merges training and test data --
A variable Xset is created that merges the data from trainsetX and testsetX with the rbind() command. This repeats for the Y (Yset) and Subject (Sset) data sets.  The columns in Xset are renamed with the labels from the features datset while the columns in Yset and Sset are named directly.  

2. Extracts only mean and std measurements
MeanSD is created that uses grep() to find the columns that have features with "mean()" or "std()" in the name. These columns are isolated in a new data frame called Xset.

3. Use descriptive activity names
Activity names are assigned using the activity information from the Y data set.

4. Label the data set
Column names are assigned to the X and Subject data sets so that the data is easier to read 

5. Independent Tidy Data Set
Using the cbind function, Xset, Sset, and activity are merged to create the CombineData variable, which is then used to create the Variable TempData using the group_by function and then it’s all summarized into the TidyData variable using the summarize_all function. This new variable can be exported to ‘tidy_data.txt' by the write.table function.
